<h1> FRISKED: Synopsis</h1>

</div>

<div id="Intro">
<p>Objective:</p> 

<p>Create an experience where those of who live in the 'other city' can get a glimpse into the experience of a person who has to be concerned with an unfair "Stop and Frisk" policy.</p>
<p>Paint a positive, realistic picture of the victims of Stop and Frisk</p>  
<p>rt: 8-12 minutes</p>

</div>

<div id="story_flow">
<p>HOW:</p> 
</br>
<p>Follow a person who is involved in a case, or has been involved in a case , in their normal day in their normal environment.   Take the viewer through mundane activities, that most people will identify with; tease how their normal life/conversations handle the problem of Stop and Frisk.</p> 

<p>When the viewer least expects it, there will be an unexpected shift in the flow of the story when it STOPS– there will be an uncomfortable transition where the viewer will dive into the uncomfortable reality of what it means to be a type of person who is subjected to Stop and Frisk.</p>

<p>Want to include: subtle running underscore of voices that speak, over b-roll to the subject of Stop and Frisk. A mother & father shares how she tries to raise her sons knowing this is always looming.  What does the do to their family.</p>

	
<p>These stopped segments could be a good place to fold in our interactive pieces.</p>
